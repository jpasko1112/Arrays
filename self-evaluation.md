<!-- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far? -->
*Ehh*, not very. I could definitely use more practice with "shift" and "unshift". Pop and push seemed pretty straight forward. Commiting these commands to memory seems vary challenging as they are longer and more complex, however, i do believe there is a simpler way to "shift" and "unshift", or at least, i hope there is.

<!-- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson? -->
Just more repitions. I would personally benefit from walking through the process with someone who is more secured in the curriculum so i could see my mistakes in real time. Fumbling around until i arrive at the desired outcome is harder to learn from.

<!-- What questions do you have about Arrays? -->
In "shift" and "unshift", what is the code actually saying? Is it possible to just run "array.shift()" and still acheive the desired result? "shift() method form : #{array.shift()}\n\n" seems unneccessarily lengthy ;)
